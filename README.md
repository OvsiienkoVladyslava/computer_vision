# Computer Vision Pet Projects
The goal of this repository is to solve some Computer Vision tasks using pre-trained models or train new ones.

The repository consists of such parts:

1. **pytorch_object_detection** - object detection pipeline to run inference of pretrained Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet from torchvision. 
2. **transfer_learning** - using pre-trained image classification models on ImageNet train new models to classify CIFAR-10 data.

Detailed information and results are shared in README of each part(package).
